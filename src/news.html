    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
        The actress and writer, 34, won the Critics’ Choice Award for best comedy series on Sunday, January 12th 2020,
        for her Amazon Prime
        series Fleabag and she thanked Jennifer Lopez for inspiring her work.
        <br>
        <br>
        “This means such a massive amount especially after seeing who we are nominated with,” Waller-Bridge said while
        accepting the award. “There is bad acting on my part. You have no idea how much you can accidentally inspire
        someone by your work.”
        <br>
        <br>
        She continued, “And someone inspired this show and that’s J. Lo. I decided that the priest’s favorite song was
        ‘Jenny from the Block’ and it opened the whole character up for me.”
